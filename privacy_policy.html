                            The Site collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and
                            consent. For instance when you list a theme or obtain a Marketing name you are asked to
                            provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Additional
                            information may also be requested depending on the Site services that you are accessing.<br>
                            Our servers may automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the

                            system you are running, the Site that referred you, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”)
                            address. Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the

                        <p class="terms_uses_p"> HOW WE USE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</p>
                        <p class="terms_uses_p"> We use personally identifiable information you supply through the Site
                            to provide you with the products or services you have requested. For example, if you obtain
                            a Marketing Name we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice. Similarly
                            if you upload or download a theme we may request personal details to confirm the
                            transaction. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features,
                            products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your
                            needs.<br>

                            information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer
                            you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your personally
                            identifying information shared, write to us at the street address set forth at the end of

                            such as escrow services or shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us
                            and by such third parties, each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your
                            information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or
